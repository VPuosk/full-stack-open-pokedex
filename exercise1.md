If we are discussing a hypothetical project we might take a look at say C#. For this language there are many different options for linting – starting from the Visual Studio’s native system (Microsoft Code Analysis) to something like StyleCop of Resharper. All of these have their pros and cons. Testing can also be done with Microsoft Testing tools (MS Unit Test), but there are also other framewords like xUnit.NET that can be used. As the language in question was developed by Microsoft it is hardly surprising that also the main build tool for it comes from the same source, namely the ubiquitous MSBuild – however as before it is certainly not the only possible tool for the job.

There are many other CI softwares other than Jenkins. CircleCI, TeamCity, Bamboo, Buddy, GitLab… the list goes on and on. Many of these are commercial softwares.

Would it be better to go with self-hosted or cloud-based environment depends on many factors. Scale and scope of the project matters a great deal as do the number of people involved as well as the equipment required. For some smaller scale one person project it might be better to go with a cloud-based solution mainly just to ease the load on your self. On the other hand on a very small project just the overhead from the test system might seem excessive (so they might want to avoid CI/CD option). As the project size grows so do the demands from the setup and especially if requirements for testing with certain equipment (like GPUs) exist then it might not even be feasible to have a cloud-based environment in use. Where the line should be drawn is however a very difficult question.
